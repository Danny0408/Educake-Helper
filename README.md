## **💡 FAQ**
### ❓ Does this tool modify my quiz answers?
No, this tool **only displays the correct answers** for reference. It does **not** change your responses or interact with Educake’s servers.

### ❓ Will I get banned for using this?
This script simply fetches answers that are already available on the website. However, **use it responsibly and at your own risk**.

### ❓ Does this work on mobile?
Yes! But mobile browsers might block running external scripts in the console. If it doesn't work on mobile, try using a desktop browser instead.
